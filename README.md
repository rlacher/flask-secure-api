A minimal authentication API built with Python and Flask, focused on showcasing secure API development principles.

## Key Features

- **Basic Authentication:** Essential user registration and login functionality.
- **Session Security:** Token-based protection for dummy data.
- **Modular Design:** Maintainable and extensible organised codebase.
- **Clear Documentation:** API endpoint description and Python Docstrings.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 100% test coverage for API reliability.
- **Memory-Based:** Simple in-memory data store for demonstration purposes.

## Quick Start

Run the authentication API locally:

1.  **Clone:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/rlacher/flask-secure-api.git
	```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
4.  **Run the API:**
	```bash
	./run.py
	```

## API Usage (Example)

A basic example of interacting with initial API endpoints.

To register, send a POST request with JSON to `/register`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "new_user", "password": "secure_password"}' http://localhost:5000/register
```

## Documentation

Project documentation is embedded in the code as docstrings. Access it
using Python's built-in `help()` function:

```python
>>> import auth
>>> help(auth)
```

For help on modules/functions, type the following:

```python
>>> from auth import routes
>>> help(auth.routes)
>>> help(auth.routes.user.register) # Help for register() function
```

## Test

### Execution

Ensure your virtual environment is activated and project dependencies are installed. To run the test suite from your project root:

```bash
pytest
```

### Coverage

To generate a detailed coverage report, including both statement and branch coverage, use the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov=auth --cov-branch --cov-report html tests/
```
After the tests complete, open `htmlcov/index.html` in a web browser to inspect the code coverage.
